--> Color coding: Here in the excel sheet we need to use xlsx instead of .csv for color formatting in the excel sheet. Additionally we need to install the 'tcom' package and run it from an outside tcl shell. This might not be possible in Vivado. If we're trying to run scripts exclusively from Vivado we need to use a python script that does the color coding in the excel sheet after the simulation is completed and results are stored in the 'simulate.log' file.
